# UC San Diego MicroMasters Data Science "Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python"
DSE 210 "Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python" (Winter 2018) by Alon Orlitsky and Yoav Freund, Professors of CS and Engineering, UC San Diego. Part 2 of »Data Science« MicroMasters®, completed 01-Sep-2019

About this course

The job of a data scientist is to glean knowledge from complex and noisy datasets. Reasoning about uncertainty is inherent in the analysis of noisy data. Probability and Statistics provide the mathematical foundation for such reasoning.

In this course, part of the Data Science MicroMasters program, you will learn the foundations of probability and statistics. You will learn both the mathematical theory, and get a hands-on experience of applying this theory to actual data using Jupyter notebooks.

Concepts covered included: random variables, dependence, correlation, regression, PCA, entropy and MDL.

What you'll learn


    The mathematical foundations for machine learning
    Statistics literacy: understand the meaning of statements such as "at a 99% confidence level"
